# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their respective symbols (commonly 'X' and 'O'). The objective is to be the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
